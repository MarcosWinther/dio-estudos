      Here I go again
      I'm imagining a world outside, unlike the one I'm in
      Daydreaming again of when I'll get a chance
      There's a world that understands
      But you don't hear the whispers in the room you're walking in
      Daydreaming again, all I need is a chance
      When I feel my fear staring at me
      I tell it just wait and see
      I know who I'm gonna be
      I know who I'm gonna be
      The world's half-asleep
      It's gonna wake up and see
      If it's a million to one
      I'm gonna be that one and
      If it's a shot in the dark
      I'm gonna be the sun
      And I just can't afford to be wrong
      Even when I'm afraid
      You're gonna know my name
      Yeah, you're gonna know my name
      Mmm, I can barely sleep
      'Cause my heart is always racing, chasing, pacing 'round the room
      Living carefully is something I don't wanna do
      When I feel my fear staring at me
      I tell it just wait and see
      I know who I'm gonna be
      I know who I'm gonna be
      The world's half-asleep
      It's gonna wake up and see
      If it's a million to one
      I'm gonna be that one and
      If it's a shot in the dark
      I'm gonna be the sun
      And I just can't afford to be wrong
      Even when I'm afraid
      You're gonna know my name
      You're gonna know my name
      And I can see her now and then
      The one I know that I could be
      Yeah
      I see her laughing
      'Cause she knew all along in her head
      So when the light is hard to see
      She's telling me
      If it's a million to one
      I'm gonna be that one and
      If it's a shot in the dark
      I'm gonna be the sun and I
      I just can't afford to be wrong (na, na, na, na, na)
      Even when I'm afraid (even when I'm afraid)
      You're gonna know my name
      You're gonna know my name
      Oh, you're gonna know my name
      You're gonna know my name, yeah
      You're gonna know my name
      You're gonna know my name
